592. Fraction Addition and Subtraction

Given a string expression representing an expression of fraction addition
and subtraction, return the calculation result in string format.

The final result should be an irreducible fraction. If your final result is
an integer, change it to the format of a fraction that has a denominator 1.
So in this case, 2 should be converted to 2/1.

Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/fraction-addition-and-subtraction/

Examples:
    Example 1:
        Input: expression = "-1/2+1/2"
        Output: "0/1"
        
    Example 2:
        Input: expression = "-1/2+1/2+1/3"
        Output: "1/3"
        
    Example 3:
        Input: expression = "1/3-1/2"
        Output: "-1/6"

Constraints:
    The input string only contains '0' to '9', '/', '+' and '-'.
    Each fraction (input and output) has the format Â±numerator/denominator.
    The numerator and denominator of each fraction will always be in the range
        [1, 10].
    The number of given fractions will be in the range [1, 10].
    The numerator and denominator of the final result are guaranteed to be
    valid and in the range of 32-bit int.

This script contains a Solution class with two methods to solve the problem:
- `fractionAddition`: The original approach to calculate the result.
- `fractionAdditionOptimized`: An optimized approach with dynamic denominator
    adjustment.

Both methods have been tested with multiple test cases.

        Approach:
        This method computes the result of adding or subtracting a sequence
        of fractions.
        It handles fractions by adjusting the common denominator dynamically
        and then reducing the fraction using the GCD.

        Time Complexity:
            O(n): We process each character in the string exactly once.

        Space Complexity:
            O(n): We store the expression and manipulate it, leading to O(n)
            space usage.
